# The Twilio-Dex

## Description
Remembering stuff is hard. Especially about people you just met (at conferences, parties, get togethers...etc). Whether its names, job titles, cities... keeping people straight across all facets of your life is difficult!

Worry no more, Twilio-dex to the rescue.


Fill out your README.md with a description of your project. We encourage you to briefly describe the value and novelty of your idea, who the target audience is, any caveats, and how you would expand upon your submission given more time.

Remove any superfluous files from your repo.

If not already, make your repository public.

Add @jhall, @staxerman, and @gcosme as collaborators to your repo as part of technical judging.

Good luck and happy hacking! ðŸ¦‰
